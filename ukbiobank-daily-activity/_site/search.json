It does not require the input of the number of communities nor their sizes before execution. It maximizes a modularity score for each community, where the modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities. This means evaluating how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.\nThe Louvain algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into a single node and executes the modularity clustering on the condensed graphs.\nSource: https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/louvain/https://towardsdatascience.com/louvain-algorithm-93fde589f58c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering Results\nParticipants within the same cluster can be regarded as people with similar sleeping conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering Treemap\n\n\n\nSignificant Variables in Clustering\n\n[1] \"waking_too_early_f20535_0_0\"                                        \n[2] \"sleeping_too_much_f20534_0_0\"                                       \n[3] \"sleeplessness_insomnia_f1200_0_0\"                                   \n[4] \"degree_bothered_by_trouble_sleeping_in_the_last_3_months_f21061_0_0\"\n[5] \"trouble_falling_or_staying_asleep_or_sleeping_too_much_f20517_0_0\"  \n[6] \"trouble_falling_asleep_f20533_0_0\"                                  \n[7] \"sleep_duration_f1160_0_0\"                                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap\nAll the significant variables in sleep clustering are correlated.

Activity score variables turn out to show significance compared to other demographic variables. Based on our findings, we can infer that accelerometry data has the potential to serve as an additional tool for predicting sleep conditions.\nHowever, the accuracy rate is still low. This is because the independent variables (especially the activity scores) represent summary data, which may have resulted in the loss of significant information during the aggregation process.” This can be solved in the future by taking full advantage of raw accelerometry data (beyond our current scope).\n\n\n\n",
